# ExchangeHouse — Implementation status

## 2026-10-29 — independent format family foundation

- Established `ExchangeHouse` as an organizational family, **not** a monolithic NuGet package.
- Added first independent `Markdown` project plus tests; see [Markdown implementation status](Markdown/IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md).
- Documented separation from `Blackboard.SpectreConsole.Markdown` and the future independent conversion helpers.
- Planned conversions include Markdown/plain text, HTML/plain text, Markdown/HTML, JSON/AJIS, JSON/XML and AJIS/XML; these **do not yet exist**.
- **Verified:** [GitHub Actions #40846902206](https://github.com/afrowaveltd/Toolbox/actions/runs/40846902206) SUCCESS for commit `3252650b` (restore, build and complete solution test workflow).

## 2026-10-29 — first inline Markdown recognition

- ExchangeHouse.Markdown now provides source-aware conservative inline nodes for emphasis, code and simple links, without depending on UI or translation runtimes.
- Advanced CommonMark, converters, localizing link resolver and the Blackboard Spectre renderer remain planned. CI verification is pending for the implementation commit.

### Verified CI — 2026-10-29

- [GitHub Actions #40848846720](https://github.com/afrowaveltd/Toolbox/actions/runs/40848846720) **SUCCESS** for inline parser commit `b566ad670bb58e52049c714b8dbba6d1f3838287` — full solution build and test passed.
- This verifies the conservative supported syntax and regressions only. Full CommonMark, editable AST, conversion and UI rendering are not yet claimed.

## 2026-10-29 — image rendering reuse

- Blackboard.SpectreConsole.Markdown displays ExchangeHouse Image nodes as styled text alternatives. No back dependency on UI in ExchangeHouse, no binary image or network operations. CI pending.

### Verified cross-platform CI — 2026-10-29

- Parser implementation commit `fb7a8108`: [GitHub Actions #40881801829](https://github.com/afrowaveltd/Toolbox/actions/runs/40881801829) **SUCCESS** — full Linux solution build/tests and existing Windows regression job.
- Image presentation implementation commit `7696fef8`: [GitHub Actions #40882016971](https://github.com/afrowaveltd/Toolbox/actions/runs/40882016971) **SUCCESS** — full Linux solution build/tests and Windows FileBrowser, Configurator, Showcase, localization **plus newly added focused ExchangeHouse Markdown and Blackboard Markdown tests**.
- No direct manual Debian or Windows terminal test of this new image fallback has been reported. Full CommonMark, reference-style links, actual image drawing and translated document link routing are still not implemented.

## 2026-10-31 — nested list source representation

- ExchangeHouse.Markdown now exposes original list numbering and indentation plus an immutable hierarchy, with exact unchanged-source round trips. The Spectre display update is a following independent increment; parser CI pending.

### Cross-platform CI verified — 2026-10-31

- [GitHub Actions #41244480220](https://github.com/afrowaveltd/Toolbox/actions/runs/41244480220) **SUCCESS** for implementation up through commit `415065a4c272838f3bc0e4ed94ab8ea90003a295`.
- Linux: full Toolbox solution **build and tests passed**; final build reported **0 warnings, 0 errors**.
- Windows: **ExchangeHouse.Markdown.Tests 41/41**, **Blackboard.SpectreConsole.Markdown.Tests 13/13**, **Blackboard.Showcase.Tests 26/26**; FileBrowser 160/160, Configurator 44/44, and targeted localization tests 34/34 passed.
- Intermediate runs on parser/renderer commits failed at **test compilation** due to literal `\\`` C# escape sequences mistakenly introduced when authoring Markdown code examples. Fixed in commits `e7b858aa` and `415065a4`; the final CI is green. Existing production source was not weakened to make tests pass.
- Manual real-terminal testing of newly added nested-list visuals in Debian/Windows remains unreported. The current model does not claim CommonMark-compatible loose/multiline lists.

## 2026-10-31 — Markdown list continuation support

- ExchangeHouse Markdown now models explicitly indented paragraph continuations within list items; renderer integration follows as an independent change. The source parser remains UI-neutral. CI pending.

### Verified CI — 2026-10-31 list continuation increment

- [GitHub Actions #41248289922](https://github.com/afrowaveltd/Toolbox/actions/runs/41248289922) **SUCCESS**, source through commit `35efe934031a99a5407550f6624d96656b9c03a3`: Linux full solution build/tests passed; Windows ExchangeHouse Markdown **46/46**, Blackboard Markdown **16/16**, Showcase **26/26**, FileBrowser **160/160**, Configurator **44/44**, localization **34/34**.
- Markdown local link job **PASS**: 269 Markdown files, 1,374 local file targets checked with none missing. Source-aware continuation behavior also tested on Windows; manual Debian and real-terminal visual checks remain separate.
- Initial renderer integration CI failed **one incorrect test expectation** (custom indent `....` erroneously checked as six literal spaces). Fixed the assertion in `35efe934`, retaining custom-indent coverage. The failed earlier CI runs are not counted as successes.
- This milestone handles only **explicitly indented** continuation lines. Loose lists, lazy continuation and nested CommonMark block containers remain unsupported. No public NuGet release was made.

## 2026-10-31 — blank-separated Markdown list paragraphs

- ExchangeHouse Markdown now retains explicit blank separators inside list items when followed by safely indented paragraphs. UI-neutral, unchanged-source and additive API; full CommonMark loose list containers remain future work. CI pending.

### Cross-platform verification — 2026-10-31

- [GitHub Actions #41249127101](https://github.com/afrowaveltd/Toolbox/actions/runs/41249127101) **SUCCESS** for source/docs commit `df4da1b285d280cbe1d17dee0fded388f178d0b8`. Linux full solution built/tested; Windows ExchangeHouse Markdown **55/55**, Blackboard Markdown **19/19**, Showcase **26/26**, FileBrowser **160/160**, Configurator **44/44**, localized tests **34/34**.
- Blank-separated explicitly indented list paragraphs now have source-preserving ownership and terminal alignment. Interim custom-indent test assertion was fixed in `2b34cb46`, with no production rendering change.
- Markdown docs link job passed. No public package release, full CommonMark claim or manual Debian visual acceptance made.

### Final green lazy-paragraph checkpoint — 2026-10-31

- [GitHub Actions #41250061417](https://github.com/afrowaveltd/Toolbox/actions/runs/41250061417) **SUCCESS** for commit `f6b7fc555c76d964ec12a27f86accc1beab3e9f8`: Linux full solution build and tests passed, Windows targeted UI/Markdown suites passed and local Markdown documentation-link check passed.
- Windows counts: **ExchangeHouse Markdown 60/60**, **Blackboard Markdown 21/21**, **Showcase 26/26**, **FileBrowser 160/160**, **Configurator 44/44**, **UnderstandMe localization 34/34**.
- Documentation audit: **273 Markdown files, 1,399 local targets checked**, zero missing links. Cross-family link typo from the first commit was fixed in `2c8c3fa`; the final gallery sample now uses an actually unindented lazy line.
- No public Markdown NuGet publication, no full CommonMark or real-terminal Debian acceptance is implied by CI.

## 2026-10-31 — fenced-code/quote container recognition

ExchangeHouse Markdown now records fenced-code language metadata, quote depth, and attached quote/code list blocks while retaining line offsets and literal-source preservation. This is bounded syntax support, not full CommonMark containers. [Detailed parser status](Markdown/IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md). CI pending for the complete follow-up changes.

### Cross-platform green verification — 2026-10-31

- [GitHub Actions #41251065292](https://github.com/afrowaveltd/Toolbox/actions/runs/41251065292) **SUCCESS** for source commit `5b80ad1e3f9cde50ae793da53b3b81c30d727d08`. Linux complete solution restore/build/tests passed, Windows targeted UI and grammar tests passed, and Markdown link validation passed.
- Windows: **ExchangeHouse Markdown 66/66**, **Blackboard Markdown 24/24**, **TextMate adapter 6/6**, **Showcase 26/26**, **FileBrowser 160/160**, **Configurator 44/44**, **UnderstandMe localization 34/34**.
- The documentation link audit examined **280 Markdown files and 1,423 local targets** with no missing targets. A later docs-only commit clarified a nested-fence illustration; final docs CI is tracked separately.
- Real TextMate C# tokenization was exercised under Linux and Windows CI, including platform-specific Oniguruma dependencies. This does **not** establish manual SSH/tmux or Debian terminal acceptance, complete CommonMark support, NuGet publication, or a completed third-party transitive-license review.

## 2026-11-01 — quoted list recognition

- Added bounded independent nested-list hierarchy inside explicit quote-prefix lines. See [Markdown status](Markdown/IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md) and [quoted list design](Markdown/Docs/Quoted-Lists/en.md). Existing source-preserving representation remains intact. CI pending.

### Verified cross-platform quoted-list milestone — 2026-11-01

- [GitHub Actions #41251673070](https://github.com/afrowaveltd/Toolbox/actions/runs/41251673070) **SUCCESS** for feature commit `aa3ec1246fc3125f17d1a506e415cc3ad7db418b`: Linux full solution build/test, Windows targeted UI tests and documentation-link job passed.
- Windows results: ExchangeHouse Markdown **71/71**, Blackboard Markdown **26/26**, optional TextMate **6/6**, Showcase **26/26**, FileBrowser **160/160**, Configurator **44/44**, localization **34/34**.
- The subsequent documentation commit introduced one incorrect cross-family relative link, fixed in `1e89cf7532c03737a0599d51c26b54cd57bb345a`. Link verification on the fix run passed; final complete CI for the documentation state is tracked independently.
- No new NuGet publication, full CommonMark conformance, or real-terminal acceptance is claimed. This feature intentionally does not tokenize fenced code inside explicitly quote-prefixed containers.

## 2026-11-01 — quoted fenced code

- Parser recognizes source-aware literal quoted code fences and quoted numbered-list ownership with conservative interruption on changed/missing quote prefixes.
- [Quoted code behavior](Markdown/Docs/Quoted-Code-Fences/en.md). Core tests passed on implementation CI [#41254427784](https://github.com/afrowaveltd/Toolbox/actions/runs/41254427784); final docs CI separate.
