# ExchangeHouse.Markdown.Tests — Implementation status

## 2026-10-29 — initial regression suite

- Added xUnit project to `Toolbox.sln` covering first-stage Markdown parser/writer behavior.
- Local SDK is unavailable in this execution environment. **Verified:** [GitHub Actions #40846902206](https://github.com/afrowaveltd/Toolbox/actions/runs/40846902206) SUCCESS for commit `3252650b` (whole solution build and test including this project).
- Current suite is intentionally scoped to the block scanner. Add independent tests before extending syntax support.

## 2026-10-29 — inline scanner tests

- Added a separate `MarkdownInlineParserTests` suite for conservative inline syntax and source-safe integration with existing blocks.
- The suite is part of the same solution CI; verification for the latest implementation commit is pending.

### Verified CI — 2026-10-29

- [GitHub Actions #40848846720](https://github.com/afrowaveltd/Toolbox/actions/runs/40848846720) **SUCCESS** for inline parser commit `b566ad670bb58e52049c714b8dbba6d1f3838287` — full solution build and test passed.
- This verifies the conservative supported syntax and regressions only. Full CommonMark, editable AST, conversion and UI rendering are not yet claimed.

## 2026-10-29 — analyzer cleanup

- Use xUnit `Assert.Single(collection, predicate)` instead of filtered LINQ `Where` to eliminate xUnit2031 without changing test semantics. CI pending.

### Verified on both platforms — 2026-10-29

- [GitHub Actions #40857564421](https://github.com/afrowaveltd/Toolbox/actions/runs/40857564421) **SUCCESS** for code/test commit `ae52a29345f0fcbef08cbf6cda41686461bc25bd`.
- Ubuntu full solution restore/build/test **PASS**; new Windows runner's **FileBrowser**, **UnderstandMe Configurator**, and **Blackboard Showcase** project test steps all **PASS**.
- The original Windows UI path-wrap failures are resolved in the automated Windows environment. Manual developer-local retest with the latest checkout remains distinct from Windows CI.

## 2026-10-29 — image/link identity test cases

- Added image, title, angle destination, escaping, nested link/image, malformed input and destination offset regressions; CI pending.

### Verified cross-platform CI — 2026-10-29

- Parser implementation commit `fb7a8108`: [GitHub Actions #40881801829](https://github.com/afrowaveltd/Toolbox/actions/runs/40881801829) **SUCCESS** — full Linux solution build/tests and existing Windows regression job.
- Image presentation implementation commit `7696fef8`: [GitHub Actions #40882016971](https://github.com/afrowaveltd/Toolbox/actions/runs/40882016971) **SUCCESS** — full Linux solution build/tests and Windows FileBrowser, Configurator, Showcase, localization **plus newly added focused ExchangeHouse Markdown and Blackboard Markdown tests**.
- No direct manual Debian or Windows terminal test of this new image fallback has been reported. Full CommonMark, reference-style links, actual image drawing and translated document link routing are still not implemented.

## 2026-10-31 — nested list parsing tests

- Added focused tests for immutable list hierarchy, mixed nested ordered items and original markers, tabs, reset boundaries, source/inline spans and rejected unsupported markers. CI pending.

### Cross-platform CI verified — 2026-10-31

- [GitHub Actions #41244480220](https://github.com/afrowaveltd/Toolbox/actions/runs/41244480220) **SUCCESS** for implementation up through commit `415065a4c272838f3bc0e4ed94ab8ea90003a295`.
- Linux: full Toolbox solution **build and tests passed**; final build reported **0 warnings, 0 errors**.
- Windows: **ExchangeHouse.Markdown.Tests 41/41**, **Blackboard.SpectreConsole.Markdown.Tests 13/13**, **Blackboard.Showcase.Tests 26/26**; FileBrowser 160/160, Configurator 44/44, and targeted localization tests 34/34 passed.
- Intermediate runs on parser/renderer commits failed at **test compilation** due to literal `\\`` C# escape sequences mistakenly introduced when authoring Markdown code examples. Fixed in commits `e7b858aa` and `415065a4`; the final CI is green. Existing production source was not weakened to make tests pass.
- Manual real-terminal testing of newly added nested-list visuals in Debian/Windows remains unreported. The current model does not claim CommonMark-compatible loose/multiline lists.

## 2026-10-31 — list continuation regression cases

- Added five cases for continuation ownership, CRLF/source offsets, ancestor after child, numbered/tabbed indentation, interruption and code protection. CI pending.

### Verified CI — 2026-10-31 list continuation increment

- [GitHub Actions #41248289922](https://github.com/afrowaveltd/Toolbox/actions/runs/41248289922) **SUCCESS**, source through commit `35efe934031a99a5407550f6624d96656b9c03a3`: Linux full solution build/tests passed; Windows ExchangeHouse Markdown **46/46**, Blackboard Markdown **16/16**, Showcase **26/26**, FileBrowser **160/160**, Configurator **44/44**, localization **34/34**.
- Markdown local link job **PASS**: 269 Markdown files, 1,374 local file targets checked with none missing. Source-aware continuation behavior also tested on Windows; manual Debian and real-terminal visual checks remain separate.
- Initial renderer integration CI failed **one incorrect test expectation** (custom indent `....` erroneously checked as six literal spaces). Fixed the assertion in `35efe934`, retaining custom-indent coverage. The failed earlier CI runs are not counted as successes.
- This milestone handles only **explicitly indented** continuation lines. Loose lists, lazy continuation and nested CommonMark block containers remain unsupported. No public NuGet release was made.

## 2026-10-31 — bounded loose-list regression tests

- Six new cases check separated paragraphs, marker boundaries, offsets, ancestor ownership and literal code. Existing explicit-continuation blank-boundary fixture now uses unindented text, so it still tests the unsupported case. CI pending.

### Cross-platform verification — 2026-10-31

- [GitHub Actions #41249127101](https://github.com/afrowaveltd/Toolbox/actions/runs/41249127101) **SUCCESS** for source/docs commit `df4da1b285d280cbe1d17dee0fded388f178d0b8`. Linux full solution built/tested; Windows ExchangeHouse Markdown **55/55**, Blackboard Markdown **19/19**, Showcase **26/26**, FileBrowser **160/160**, Configurator **44/44**, localized tests **34/34**.
- Blank-separated explicitly indented list paragraphs now have source-preserving ownership and terminal alignment. Interim custom-indent test assertion was fixed in `2b34cb46`, with no production rendering change.
- Markdown docs link job passed. No public package release, full CommonMark claim or manual Debian visual acceptance made.

## 2026-10-31 — lazy paragraph continuation regression cases

- Added five focused cases for unindented inline/source offsets, nested ownership, blank boundaries, block-starter interruptions and mixed explicit/lazy/loose paragraphs.
- Previous no-lazy fixture was adjusted to include a blank paragraph boundary, retaining its intended non-attachment guarantee.
- **CI pending**; prior 55/55 suite remains the last independently verified parser result.

### Final green lazy-paragraph checkpoint — 2026-10-31

- [GitHub Actions #41250061417](https://github.com/afrowaveltd/Toolbox/actions/runs/41250061417) **SUCCESS** for commit `f6b7fc555c76d964ec12a27f86accc1beab3e9f8`: Linux full solution build and tests passed, Windows targeted UI/Markdown suites passed and local Markdown documentation-link check passed.
- Windows counts: **ExchangeHouse Markdown 60/60**, **Blackboard Markdown 21/21**, **Showcase 26/26**, **FileBrowser 160/160**, **Configurator 44/44**, **UnderstandMe localization 34/34**.
- Documentation audit: **273 Markdown files, 1,399 local targets checked**, zero missing links. Cross-family link typo from the first commit was fixed in `2c8c3fa`; the final gallery sample now uses an actually unindented lazy line.
- No public Markdown NuGet publication, no full CommonMark or real-terminal Debian acceptance is implied by CI.

## 2026-10-31 — code/quote regression cases

Added parser tests for source-aware language hints, fenced-code isolation from Markdown, nested list parent/child ownership, quotes/inline offsets and blank-separated containers. An older top-level quote expectation was updated to `BlockQuote`. CI pending for final implementation.

### Cross-platform green verification — 2026-10-31

- [GitHub Actions #41251065292](https://github.com/afrowaveltd/Toolbox/actions/runs/41251065292) **SUCCESS** for source commit `5b80ad1e3f9cde50ae793da53b3b81c30d727d08`. Linux complete solution restore/build/tests passed, Windows targeted UI and grammar tests passed, and Markdown link validation passed.
- Windows: **ExchangeHouse Markdown 66/66**, **Blackboard Markdown 24/24**, **TextMate adapter 6/6**, **Showcase 26/26**, **FileBrowser 160/160**, **Configurator 44/44**, **UnderstandMe localization 34/34**.
- The documentation link audit examined **280 Markdown files and 1,423 local targets** with no missing targets. A later docs-only commit clarified a nested-fence illustration; final docs CI is tracked separately.
- Real TextMate C# tokenization was exercised under Linux and Windows CI, including platform-specific Oniguruma dependencies. This does **not** establish manual SSH/tmux or Debian terminal acceptance, complete CommonMark support, NuGet publication, or a completed third-party transitive-license review.

## 2026-11-01 — quoted list parser regressions

- Five new tests for nested ordered/regular quoted lists, exact source roundtrip and offsets, explicit/lazy continuation ownership, quote-depth/list boundaries, heading/blank interruption and conservative quote-prefixed fenced-code fallback. CI pending; prior independently verified parser count 66.

### Verified cross-platform quoted-list milestone — 2026-11-01

- [GitHub Actions #41251673070](https://github.com/afrowaveltd/Toolbox/actions/runs/41251673070) **SUCCESS** for feature commit `aa3ec1246fc3125f17d1a506e415cc3ad7db418b`: Linux full solution build/test, Windows targeted UI tests and documentation-link job passed.
- Windows results: ExchangeHouse Markdown **71/71**, Blackboard Markdown **26/26**, optional TextMate **6/6**, Showcase **26/26**, FileBrowser **160/160**, Configurator **44/44**, localization **34/34**.
- The subsequent documentation commit introduced one incorrect cross-family relative link, fixed in `1e89cf7532c03737a0599d51c26b54cd57bb345a`. Link verification on the fix run passed; final complete CI for the documentation state is tracked independently.
- No new NuGet publication, full CommonMark conformance, or real-terminal acceptance is claimed. This feature intentionally does not tokenize fenced code inside explicitly quote-prefixed containers.
