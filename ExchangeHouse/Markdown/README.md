# Afrowave.Toolbox.ExchangeHouse.Markdown

Small, UI-neutral .NET 10 Markdown parsing foundation for the ExchangeHouse family.

**Status: initial source-preserving block and conservative inline scanner, with a lossless unchanged-document writer. Not full CommonMark, an editable AST, or a Markdown converter. Not published to NuGet.**

## Current API

```csharp
using Afrowave.Toolbox.ExchangeHouse.Markdown;

var document = MarkdownParser.Parse("# Hello\r\n- item\r\n");
var heading = document.Blocks[0]; // Heading, level 1, text "Hello"
var inline = document.Blocks[0].Inlines; // source-aware inline nodes
var unchanged = MarkdownWriter.Write(document);
```

- Recognizes ATX headings (1-6), simple list markers, blank lines, ordinary lines, fenced code delimiters and fenced code contents.
- Retains exact original line text, offsets, whitespace and CRLF/LF/CR terminators.
- Does not evaluate or execute Markdown, links or raw HTML; requires no UI, filesystem or networking.
- Adds conservative inline nodes for simple emphasis, strong text, code spans and `[label](destination)` links (including nested parentheses). Nodes retain raw source spans; link destinations are preserved exactly. Fenced code remains uninterpreted.
- Keeps physical lines separate: advanced nesting, multiline paragraphs, images, reference links, link titles, tables and full CommonMark conformance are future increments.
- Writing currently reconstructs the unchanged document; **no source-transforming writer or converters are claimed**.

## Testing

```bash
dotnet test ExchangeHouse/Markdown.Tests/Afrowave.Toolbox.ExchangeHouse.Markdown.Tests.csproj
```

NuGet release is deferred until the model/API matures and CI passes.
