# Implementation status

Last updated: 2026-08-01

This file is the continuation point for `Toolroom/WhenItFails/Setter` development. Update it after every implementation, test, catalog, or documentation change that alters the current state or recommended next step.

## Current state

WhenItFails Setter is a mature .NET 10 command-line authoring and maintenance tool for the project-local catalogs under `Jsons/WhenItFails`.

The latest user-verified Setter test run reported **1,241 passed, 0 failed, 0 skipped**. The complete Setter suite is green.

The complete `WhenItFails.Tests` core suite is user-verified green with **696 passed, 0 failed, 0 skipped**.

The runtime/public-API audit has verified defensive handling of provider failures, null tasks, null responses, null payloads, runtime-null issue collections and elements, cross-validation envelopes, successful-provider diagnostic aggregation, status normalization, and required inner members of `ErrorCatalogProviderPayload`.

## Verification status

Recently verified focused contracts include:

- `TemperatureLimitExceededCatalogTests`: **1 user-verified green**.
- `CriticalTemperatureLimitExceededCatalogTests`: **1 user-verified green**.
- `TemperatureSensorReadingInvalidCatalogTests`: **1 user-verified green**.
- `TemperatureReadingStaleCatalogTests`: **1 user-verified green**.
- `DefaultJsonsTemplateProviderTests.GetTemplateFiles_ShouldIncludeThermalCatalogAndRevisedOwnerRanges`: **1 user-verified green**.
- Complete catalog validation after adding `AFW_THM_0004`: **0 errors, 0 warnings, 0 information issues**.
- Complete `WhenItFails.Tests`: **696 user-verified green, 0 failed, 0 skipped**.
- Complete `Toolroom/WhenItFails/Setter.Tests`: **1,241 user-verified green, 0 failed, 0 skipped**.

The thermal domain uses category `THERMAL`, code group `THERMAL`, prefix `THM`, and range `1000000–1099999`.

The first four thermal definitions are complete and verified:

- `AFW_THM_0001` / `1000001` / `TEMPERATURELIMITEXCEEDED` / `Warning`;
- `AFW_THM_0002` / `1000002` / `CRITICALTEMPERATURELIMITEXCEEDED` / `Critical`;
- `AFW_THM_0003` / `1000003` / `TEMPERATURESENSORREADINGINVALID` / `Error`;
- `AFW_THM_0004` / `1000004` / `TEMPERATUREREADINGSTALE` / `Error`.

`TEMPERATUREREADINGSTALE` represents a reading that may be structurally valid and plausible but is too old for safe decision-making. It is distinct from invalid-reading and limit-exceeded contracts.

Because bootstrap templates are generated from embedded authoritative catalogs, all four verified thermal definitions flow into newly initialized workspaces after rebuild. Existing project-local catalogs remain untouched by bootstrap.

The authoritative owner catalog continues to use non-overlapping ranges:

- `AFW`: `0–1099999`;
- `APP`: `1100000–1999999`;
- `PLUGIN`: `2000000–2999999`;
- `USER`: `9000000–9999999`.

## Focused verification

The complete core baseline is:

```powershell
dotnet test WhenItFails.Tests
```

Latest user-verified result: **696 passed, 0 failed, 0 skipped**.

The complete catalog workspace remains user-verified green:

```powershell
dotnet run --project Toolroom/WhenItFails/Setter -- validate .
```

Latest user-verified result: **0 errors, 0 warnings, and 0 information issues**.

The complete Setter suite remains available through:

```powershell
dotnet test Toolroom/WhenItFails/Setter.Tests
```

Before committing further catalog changes, also run:

```powershell
dotnet run --project Toolroom/WhenItFails/Setter -- check-doc-keys .
dotnet run --project Toolroom/WhenItFails/Setter -- check-doc-links .
git diff --check
```

## Documentation synchronization completed

Maintained English documentation includes:

- `README.md` and `Readme/en.md`;
- `Docs/Overview/en.md`;
- `Docs/Commands/en.md`;
- `Docs/Known Limitations/en.md`;
- `Docs/Roadmap and Future Work/en.md`;
- `Docs/Getting-Started/en.md`;
- `Docs/FAQ/en.md`;
- `Docs/Testing and CI/en.md`;
- `Docs/Reviewing Catalog Changes/en.md`;
- `WhenItFails/Docs/Bootstrap/en.md`;
- `WhenItFails/Docs/Thermal Errors/en.md`.

`WhenItFails/Docs/Thermal Errors/en.md` documents all four verified thermal contracts and explicitly separates invalid-value trust from measurement freshness.

## Current intentional boundaries

Setter currently does not provide automatic schema migration, multi-file atomic transactions, multi-process locking, automatic translation generation, remote catalog synchronization, package publishing, a GUI, complete source-code dependency discovery, or automatic runtime behavior for humorous message variants.

Thermal easter eggs are explicitly deferred. Any future alternative wording must never alter the structured contract, severity, metadata, thresholds, control flow, shutdown decision, restart policy, sensor trust decision, data-freshness decision, thermal-trend decision, or fail-safe policy.

## Working rules

- GitHub `master` is the source of truth.
- Keep each change narrow and intentional.
- Add or update tests immediately.
- Do not advance while the current slice is red.
- Update this file after every change.
- Prefer one file plus its directly related test, then commit.

## Recommended next step

Add a standalone red catalog contract for `TEMPERATURERATEOFCHANGEEXCEEDED`. Do not change the authoritative production catalog until the exact expected missing-item failure is user-verified.

## Last completed change

The `AFW_THM_0004` increment is closed with **696/696 user-verified green core tests**. Its catalog definition, workspace validation, bootstrap propagation, and English documentation are synchronized.
