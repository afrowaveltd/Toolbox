# Implementation status

Last updated: 2026-08-02

This file is the continuation point for `Toolroom/WhenItFails/Setter` development. Update it after every implementation, test, catalog, or documentation change that alters the current state or recommended next step.

## Current state

WhenItFails Setter is a mature .NET 10 command-line authoring and maintenance tool for the project-local catalogs under `Jsons/WhenItFails`.

The latest user-verified Setter test run reported **1,241 passed, 0 failed, 0 skipped**. The complete Setter suite is green.

The complete `WhenItFails.Tests` core suite is user-verified green with **700 passed, 0 failed, 0 skipped** before the thermal-protection-action catalog test was added. The next complete run should contain **701 tests**.

The runtime/public-API audit has verified defensive handling of provider failures, null tasks, null responses, null payloads, runtime-null issue collections and elements, cross-validation envelopes, successful-provider diagnostic aggregation, status normalization, and required inner members of `ErrorCatalogProviderPayload`.

## Verification status

Recently verified focused contracts include:

- `TemperatureLimitExceededCatalogTests`: **1 user-verified green**.
- `CriticalTemperatureLimitExceededCatalogTests`: **1 user-verified green**.
- `TemperatureSensorReadingInvalidCatalogTests`: **1 user-verified green**.
- `TemperatureReadingStaleCatalogTests`: **1 user-verified green**.
- `TemperatureRateOfChangeExceededCatalogTests`: **1 user-verified green**.
- `TemperatureSensorDisagreementCatalogTests`: **1 user-verified green**.
- `TemperatureBelowMinimumLimitCatalogTests`: **1 user-verified green**.
- `CriticalTemperatureBelowMinimumLimitCatalogTests`: **1 user-verified green**.
- `ThermalProtectionActionFailedCatalogTests`: **1 user-verified green**.
- `DefaultJsonsTemplateProviderTests.GetTemplateFiles_ShouldIncludeThermalCatalogAndRevisedOwnerRanges`: **1 user-verified green**.
- Complete catalog validation after adding `AFW_THM_0009`: **0 errors, 0 warnings, 0 information issues**.
- Complete `WhenItFails.Tests`: **700 user-verified green, 0 failed, 0 skipped** before the latest test addition.
- Complete `Toolroom/WhenItFails/Setter.Tests`: **1,241 user-verified green, 0 failed, 0 skipped**.

The thermal domain uses category `THERMAL`, code group `THERMAL`, prefix `THM`, and range `1000000–1099999`.

The first nine thermal definitions are present and focused-validation verified:

- `AFW_THM_0001` / `1000001` / `TEMPERATURELIMITEXCEEDED` / `Warning`;
- `AFW_THM_0002` / `1000002` / `CRITICALTEMPERATURELIMITEXCEEDED` / `Critical`;
- `AFW_THM_0003` / `1000003` / `TEMPERATURESENSORREADINGINVALID` / `Error`;
- `AFW_THM_0004` / `1000004` / `TEMPERATUREREADINGSTALE` / `Error`;
- `AFW_THM_0005` / `1000005` / `TEMPERATURERATEOFCHANGEEXCEEDED` / `Warning`;
- `AFW_THM_0006` / `1000006` / `TEMPERATURESENSORDISAGREEMENT` / `Warning`;
- `AFW_THM_0007` / `1000007` / `TEMPERATUREBELOWMINIMUMLIMIT` / `Warning`;
- `AFW_THM_0008` / `1000008` / `CRITICALTEMPERATUREBELOWMINIMUMLIMIT` / `Critical`;
- `AFW_THM_0009` / `1000009` / `THERMALPROTECTIONACTIONFAILED` / `Critical`.

`THERMALPROTECTIONACTIONFAILED` uses message `Thermal protection action {action} failed for {component} while handling {condition}.`, categories `THERMAL` and `GENERAL`, subcategories `PROTECTION_ACTION` and `FAIL_SAFE`, tags `THERMAL`, `FAIL_SAFE`, `SHUTDOWN`, `OPERATOR_ACTION_REQUIRED`, and `USER_VISIBLE`, and documentation key `when-it-fails/errors/thermal/thermal-protection-action-failed`.

This contract represents failure to execute or verify an application-selected protective response after a thermal condition has already been detected. It does not replace the original threshold, sensor, freshness, trend, or redundancy condition. Both the triggering condition and the protection-action failure should normally remain visible.

Because bootstrap templates are generated from embedded authoritative catalogs, all nine thermal definitions flow into newly initialized workspaces after rebuild. Existing project-local catalogs remain untouched by bootstrap.

The authoritative owner catalog continues to use non-overlapping ranges:

- `AFW`: `0–1099999`;
- `APP`: `1100000–1999999`;
- `PLUGIN`: `2000000–2999999`;
- `USER`: `9000000–9999999`.

## Focused verification

The thermal-protection-action contract is user-verified green:

```bash
dotnet test WhenItFails.Tests --filter FullyQualifiedName~ThermalProtectionActionFailedCatalogTests
```

Latest user-verified result: **1 passed, 0 failed, 0 skipped**.

The complete catalog workspace is user-verified green after adding `AFW_THM_0009`:

```bash
dotnet run --project Toolroom/WhenItFails/Setter -- validate .
```

Latest user-verified result: **0 errors, 0 warnings, and 0 information issues**.

The final gate for this increment is the complete core project:

```bash
dotnet test WhenItFails.Tests
```

Expected next full result: **701 passed, 0 failed, 0 skipped**.

The complete Setter suite remains available through:

```bash
dotnet test Toolroom/WhenItFails/Setter.Tests
```

Before committing further catalog changes, also run these commands individually:

```bash
dotnet run --project Toolroom/WhenItFails/Setter -- check-doc-keys .
dotnet run --project Toolroom/WhenItFails/Setter -- check-doc-links .
git diff --check
```

## Documentation synchronization completed

Maintained English documentation includes:

- `README.md` and `Readme/en.md`;
- `Docs/Overview/en.md`;
- `Docs/Commands/en.md`;
- `Docs/Known Limitations/en.md`;
- `Docs/Roadmap and Future Work/en.md`;
- `Docs/Getting-Started/en.md`;
- `Docs/FAQ/en.md`;
- `Docs/Testing and CI/en.md`;
- `Docs/Reviewing Catalog Changes/en.md`;
- `WhenItFails/Docs/Bootstrap/en.md`;
- `WhenItFails/Docs/Thermal Errors/en.md`.

`WhenItFails/Docs/Thermal Errors/en.md` now documents all nine thermal contracts. The protection-action section preserves the triggering thermal error, distinguishes policy selection from execution failure, requires structured actuator and verification evidence, warns against unsafe automatic retries, and leaves fallback and restart authorization to application policy.

## Current intentional boundaries

Setter currently does not provide automatic schema migration, multi-file atomic transactions, multi-process locking, automatic translation generation, remote catalog synchronization, package publishing, a GUI, complete source-code dependency discovery, or automatic runtime behavior for humorous message variants.

Thermal easter eggs are explicitly deferred. Any future alternative wording must never alter the structured contract, severity, metadata, thresholds, control flow, shutdown decision, restart policy, sensor trust decision, data-freshness decision, thermal-trend decision, redundancy decision, low-temperature decision, critical low-temperature decision, protection-action decision, or fail-safe policy.

## Working rules

- GitHub `master` is the source of truth.
- Keep each change narrow and intentional.
- Add or update tests immediately.
- Do not advance while the current slice is red.
- Update this file after every change.
- Prefer one file plus its directly related test, then commit.
- Prefer one-line shell commands and avoid line-continuation characters where practical.
- Match command examples to the user's current shell; the current working shell is Bash on Linux.
- Use the user's `to-clipboard` helper whenever a long local output or file content is needed.

## Recommended next step

Run the complete `WhenItFails.Tests` project. Do not add another thermal definition until the expected **701-test** core gate is user-verified green.

## Last completed change

The English thermal documentation now includes `THERMALPROTECTIONACTIONFAILED` and preserves the boundary between detecting a thermal condition and failing to execute or verify the selected protective response. The remaining gate is the complete core regression suite.
