# Implementation status

Last updated: 2026-08-01

This file is the continuation point for `Toolroom/WhenItFails/Setter` development. Update it after every implementation, test, catalog, or documentation change that alters the current state or recommended next step.

## Current state

WhenItFails Setter is a mature .NET 10 command-line authoring and maintenance tool for the project-local catalogs under `Jsons/WhenItFails`.

The latest user-verified Setter test run reported **1,241 passed, 0 failed, 0 skipped**. The complete Setter suite is green.

The runtime/public-API audit has also verified defensive handling of provider failures, null tasks, null responses, null payloads, runtime-null issue collections and elements, cross-validation envelopes, successful-provider diagnostic aggregation, status normalization, and required inner members of `ErrorCatalogProviderPayload`.

## Verification status

Recently verified focused contracts include:

- `ErrorCatalogContextProviderSuccessfulEnvelopeSuppressionTests`: **2 user-verified green**.
- `ErrorCatalogContextProviderSuccessfulStatusNormalizationTests`: **3 user-verified green**.
- `ErrorCatalogContextProviderEmptyWarningEnvelopeNormalizationTests`: **3 user-verified green**.
- `ErrorCatalogContextProviderNullInnerPayloadTests`: **2 user-verified green**.
- `TemperatureLimitExceededCatalogTests`: **1 user-verified green**.
- Complete `Toolroom/WhenItFails/Setter.Tests`: **1,241 user-verified green, 0 failed, 0 skipped**.

The thermal domain is registered with category `THERMAL`, code group `THERMAL`, prefix `THM`, and range `1000000–1099999`.

The first thermal definition is present:

- ID `AFW_THM_0001`;
- code `1000001`;
- name `TEMPERATURELIMITEXCEEDED`;
- parameterized message using `{temperature}`, `{unit}`, and `{limit}`;
- default severity `Warning`;
- categories `THERMAL` and `VALIDATION`;
- documentation key `when-it-fails/errors/thermal/temperature-limit-exceeded`.

The focused catalog test is user-verified green. The complete workspace validation is also user-verified green after correcting the built-in owner ranges.

The authoritative owner catalog now uses these non-overlapping ranges:

- `AFW`: `0–1099999`;
- `APP`: `1100000–1999999`;
- `PLUGIN`: `2000000–2999999`;
- `USER`: `9000000–9999999`.

No existing error code was renumbered. The formerly reserved `APP` range had no catalog definitions, so moving its lower boundary preserved compatibility while allowing the built-in thermal block to remain `1000000–1099999`.

## Focused verification

The complete catalog workspace is user-verified green:

```powershell
dotnet run --project Toolroom/WhenItFails/Setter -- validate .
```

Latest user-verified result: **0 errors, 0 warnings, and 0 information issues**.

The focused thermal contract remains available through:

```powershell
dotnet test WhenItFails.Tests --filter FullyQualifiedName~TemperatureLimitExceededCatalogTests
```

Latest user-verified result: **1 green test**.

The complete Setter suite remains available through:

```powershell
dotnet test Toolroom/WhenItFails/Setter.Tests
```

Before committing further catalog changes, also run:

```powershell
dotnet run --project Toolroom/WhenItFails/Setter -- check-doc-keys .
dotnet run --project Toolroom/WhenItFails/Setter -- check-doc-links .
git diff --check
```

## Documentation synchronization completed

Maintained English documentation includes:

- `README.md` and `Readme/en.md`;
- `Docs/Overview/en.md`;
- `Docs/Commands/en.md`;
- `Docs/Known Limitations/en.md`;
- `Docs/Roadmap and Future Work/en.md`;
- `Docs/Getting-Started/en.md`;
- `Docs/FAQ/en.md`;
- `Docs/Testing and CI/en.md`;
- `Docs/Reviewing Catalog Changes/en.md`;
- `WhenItFails/Docs/Thermal Errors/en.md`.

Next documentation target: synchronize the bootstrap owner template, bootstrap thermal category/code-group/error templates, owner-range documentation, and maintained reference catalog copies. Keep this file synchronized while the runtime/public-API audit continues.

## Current intentional boundaries

Setter currently does not provide automatic schema migration, multi-file atomic transactions, multi-process locking, automatic translation generation, remote catalog synchronization, package publishing, a GUI, complete source-code dependency discovery, or automatic runtime behavior for humorous message variants.

Thermal easter eggs are explicitly deferred. Any future absurd-temperature wording must never alter the structured contract, severity, metadata, thresholds, or application decision-making.

## Working rules

- GitHub `master` is the source of truth.
- Keep each change narrow and intentional.
- Add or update tests immediately.
- Do not advance while the current slice is red.
- Update this file after every change.
- Prefer one file plus its directly related test, then commit.

## Recommended next step

Add a focused bootstrap-template test that requires newly initialized workspaces to receive the revised owner ranges and the thermal category, code group, and first error definition. Confirm the test fails against the current embedded templates before synchronizing `DefaultJsonsTemplateProvider` and maintained reference catalogs.

## Last completed change

The latest slice closes the first thermal catalog increment. `TemperatureLimitExceededCatalogTests` is **1 user-verified green test**, and the complete `Setter validate .` run is user-verified green with **0 errors, 0 warnings, and 0 information issues**. `AFW_THM_0001` remains code `1000001`; the authoritative owner ranges now accommodate the built-in thermal block without overlap or renumbering. The next slice must protect and synchronize bootstrap generation rather than adding another thermal error prematurely.
