# Blackboard.SpectreConsole.Markdown.Tests — Implementation status

## 2026-10-29 — first regression suite

- Added dedicated xUnit + Spectre.Console.Testing project and registered in Toolbox.sln.
- Covered basic formatted rendering, custom theme options, raw markup isolation, control characters, link targets, unchanged document and argument guards.
- CI verification pending. Real terminal smoke has not been performed.

### Verified CI — 2026-10-29

- [GitHub Actions #40851606376](https://github.com/afrowaveltd/Toolbox/actions/runs/40851606376) **SUCCESS** for commit `6f917928538f3e8342e9cd56f1b84be2feb8a104`: full solution restore, build and test passed, including Markdown renderer virtual-terminal tests.
- The first attempt used unsupported mutable `Spectre.Console.Text.Append`; the next build revealed one overly broad ANSI test assertion. Both were corrected in commits `6c754fa0` and `6f917928` respectively, then confirmed green. No manual Debian/Windows terminal validation or NuGet publication claimed.

## 2026-10-29 — image rendering tests

- Added virtual terminal cases for image alt text, independent display of original image paths, style overrides and raw markup safety; CI pending.

### Verified cross-platform CI — 2026-10-29

- Parser implementation commit `fb7a8108`: [GitHub Actions #40881801829](https://github.com/afrowaveltd/Toolbox/actions/runs/40881801829) **SUCCESS** — full Linux solution build/tests and existing Windows regression job.
- Image presentation implementation commit `7696fef8`: [GitHub Actions #40882016971](https://github.com/afrowaveltd/Toolbox/actions/runs/40882016971) **SUCCESS** — full Linux solution build/tests and Windows FileBrowser, Configurator, Showcase, localization **plus newly added focused ExchangeHouse Markdown and Blackboard Markdown tests**.
- No direct manual Debian or Windows terminal test of this new image fallback has been reported. Full CommonMark, reference-style links, actual image drawing and translated document link routing are still not implemented.

## 2026-10-31 — nested list presentation regressions

- Added assertions for ordered number preservation, nested indentation, marker theme switches, and fenced code isolation. Linux/Windows CI pending.

### Cross-platform CI verified — 2026-10-31

- [GitHub Actions #41244480220](https://github.com/afrowaveltd/Toolbox/actions/runs/41244480220) **SUCCESS** for implementation up through commit `415065a4c272838f3bc0e4ed94ab8ea90003a295`.
- Linux: full Toolbox solution **build and tests passed**; final build reported **0 warnings, 0 errors**.
- Windows: **ExchangeHouse.Markdown.Tests 41/41**, **Blackboard.SpectreConsole.Markdown.Tests 13/13**, **Blackboard.Showcase.Tests 26/26**; FileBrowser 160/160, Configurator 44/44, and targeted localization tests 34/34 passed.
- Intermediate runs on parser/renderer commits failed at **test compilation** due to literal `\\`` C# escape sequences mistakenly introduced when authoring Markdown code examples. Fixed in commits `e7b858aa` and `415065a4`; the final CI is green. Existing production source was not weakened to make tests pass.
- Manual real-terminal testing of newly added nested-list visuals in Debian/Windows remains unreported. The current model does not claim CommonMark-compatible loose/multiline lists.
